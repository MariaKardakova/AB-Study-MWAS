Gut Microbiome and Depression: Analysis Pipelines

This repository provides code and documentation for a multi-layered investigation of the relationship between the human gut microbiome and major depressive disorder (MDD). The study was conducted using 16S rRNA data from the Atlas Biomed cohort and includes discovery-replication design, meta-analysis, risk scoring, and causal inference using Mendelian Randomization (MR).

üìÅ Repository Contents
1. Primary Microbiome‚ÄìDepression Analysis
Script: GitHub_depression_V1.R‚Ä®Purpose:
* Identifies bacterial taxa associated with MDD.
* Implements diversity analyses, differential abundance, and meta-analysis.
Main Steps:
* Data cleaning and case/control definition.
* Discovery vs. replication cohort split.
* Alpha and beta diversity (Shannon, Simpson, Bray-Curtis).
* Differential abundance using:
    * MaAsLin2 (relative abundances).
    * ANCOM-BC2 (absolute counts).
* Meta-analysis of differential abundance.
* Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg FDR correction.
Outputs:
* maaslin_results_discovery.csv, replication.csv
* ancombc2_results_discovery.csv, replication.csv
* meta_analysis_results.csv, significant_taxa.csv
Visualisations:
* Violin and PCoA plots for diversity.
* Volcano and bar plots for taxa significance.
* Heatmaps of log-fold changes.

2. Microbiome Risk Score (MRS), Mediation, and Causal Inference
Script: GitHub_depression_MRS_MR_V1.R‚Ä®Purpose:
* Explores microbiome-depression links via advanced statistical models.
* Constructs and validates a microbiome risk score (MRS) for depression.
* Performs MR and mediation analysis.
Main Steps:
* Two-sample MR using MiBioGen and GWAS summary statistics:
    * IVW, MR-Egger, Weighted Median, MR-PRESSO.
* Sensitivity tests for pleiotropy and heterogeneity.
